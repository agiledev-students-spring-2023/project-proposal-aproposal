# Project Proposal

Project title
DocFinder

What and why?
What software system would you like to build this semester, and why? Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important.

This software will be used to search for doctors based on several different factors, including location and specialty, as well as other filters and rank the search results with some proprietary methods. Nowadays it is difficult for people to find doctors for very specific conditions or injuries, even doctors may have difficulty referring patients to the best doctors of some other specialty. 

For whom?
Who will this software be for? These people are your end-users or customers.

This software will be for patients who are looking for a doctor to treat a particular condition when they may not have the knowledge to find the best doctors in their area or other areas. Patients will also be able to leave reviews which will partially affect the rankings of the doctor.

How?
A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

This system will take publicly available data on licensed physicians and rank them based on numerous factors and will also have a search feature for users to find the specific types of doctors they need and in which locations. It will have a login page where users will be able to make accounts and see their history of medical visits as well as make reviews on these doctors as well. However, users will be able to access all of the rankings or search features without making an account as well. 

Scope
A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.

Assuming that this data is not impossible or extremely costly to attain, it covers many aspects of what this course is trying to achieve. Building a user interface that allows users to look through ranks and search for doctors, creating APIs that will allow the front end to access this data, and storing user information inside of a database. User accounts will also delve into user authentication and authorization methods. This project may be slightly ambitious, however, if the data is readily available, it is as feasible as any other sort of feature loaded app, like food delivery services and other restaurant rating apps.
